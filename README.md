# ⭐ TWO-HADRON OPERATORS ⭐



All two-hadron operators are also taken from spectroscopy.pdf (from section 7.2). To specify the two-hadron operator we always need to specify:

The representation: ***I<sub>A</sub> × I<sub>B</sub>*** = [***I<sub>A</sub>***, ***I<sub>B</sub>***] = rep. The order of ***I<sub>A</sub>***  and ***I<sub>B</sub>*** must be taken exactly as given in spectroscopy.pdf-section 7.2.
